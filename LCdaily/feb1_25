//SPECIAL ARRAY 1
// an array is considered special if every pair of its adjacent elements contains two numbers with different parity.

//NOTE:: **parity here in this question simply means if the number is even or odd :) check sample cases before jumping **

 //a very useless thought process might be to calculate frequency in a 
 //unordered map and then doing mod 2 
 // but you can just mod 2 on the element itself ; - ; 
 //PARITY IN THIS CASE MEANS IF NUMBER IS ODD OR EVEN< NO CONT> SHOULD BE BOTH EVEN OR BOTH ODD  .
