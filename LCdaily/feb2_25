//to check if array is sorted or sorted and rotated (increasin order)
//keeping a counter variable - count to keep track
// if there is no rotation but array is sorted then while iterating through array all next element should be greater than current 
//increase count if a next element is less than current element 
// 3 4 5 1 2   in this case of sorted and rotated we can see we get 1 count in case of rotated array 
// lets say we have something like 3 5 6 4 now 4 is lesser than 6 but greater than 3 , this isnt rotated , so keep track of last and first elemtn //
//in any case for sorted or sorted and rotated count should reach a maximum of 1 .
